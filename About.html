<h2>
FEVR; I derived the name in early 2017. I had previously been producing music under a different artist name for a few years. When I was 10 years old I used to mess about on free online music producing software, and I eventually developed a passion for creating music. I am now a 14 year old from Sydney, Australia producing music. I sell rights to my lyric-less tracks to other artists so that they can make full songs out of them while I recieve money for my work. I make music I feel like making, I make my own style to sound unique and interesting, to stand out. I have been making full tracks for about a year and a half now and I look forward to what i will do in the future. Stay tuned for what will come from me in 2018.
